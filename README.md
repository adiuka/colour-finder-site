# colour-finder-site

The simple webapp that allows you to extract the HEX colour codes that are the most dominant in an uplaoded image.
Simply upload any image, and watch the magic happen. Can take longer depending on image size, as it will take longer to read more pixels.

Some future improvements:
1. I would like to develop functionality that find similar colours, and does not show them. Not really sure how to do that, but could give a more distinct pallete. As the issue is not that if there is a lot of shadow or sun, it will give back so much white HEX codes.
2. I would like to add functionality that generates an excel sheet of your colours. Could be fun and maybe useful.
3. Would like to add a dropdown box, that allows you to choose how many colours you would like to be shown. The default is 10.
4. In general make it look better, now looks more like a module attachement.

Otherwise, enjoy!
